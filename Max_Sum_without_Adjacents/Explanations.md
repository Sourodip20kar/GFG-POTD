# Max Sum without Adjacents
Given an array Arr of size N containing positive integers. Find the maximum sum of a subsequence such that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array.

``Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5}
Output: 110
Explanation: If you take indices 0, 3
and 5, then Arr[0]+Arr[3]+Arr[5] =
5+100+5 = 110.``
